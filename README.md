# EquCyph
The Cross-platform Mathematics equation parser and plotter

# What is Equcyph
> Equcyph is a mathematics tool or software for drawing all kinds of 2d line graphs from, from simple straight lines (`mx + c`) to trigonometry (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`) and beyond. The program works on all major operating systems and it is easy to use and install.

# Why?
> In 2023 my younger sister was starting middle school (Grade 7 in South Africa) and she would be introduced to algebra for the first time. I had an idea of teaching it to he through visualization, especially when it comes to graphs such as parabola and hyperbola.
> The first version was barebones but allowed the teaching to flow and for her to see the graphs, then I had another idea: `If it can help my sister, why not provide it to all and see how helpful it can be`.
